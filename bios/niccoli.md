Matteo Niccoli was created a geologist at the University of Rome, Italy, but then went rogue after a successful gravity and magnetics campaign in the Southern Tuscany mining district and decided to become a Geophysicist. As part of the self-reprogramming he started (and completed) a Masterâ€™s degree at the University of Calgary and has now been working for 14 years in the E&P business, mostly in Calgary, Alberta, but with a stint in Stavanger, Norway. He is a registered Geophysicist with APEGA, the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta, and is currently happily employed by Birchcliff Energy. He is an independent entrepreneur with MyCarta and a Geoscience blogger / researcher. He loves Python and tinkering with stuff that does not work, but should. He is @my_carta on Twitter.
