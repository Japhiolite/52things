Rob is a geologist who's passion for fractures and fluid-flow led him to geocomputing during his PhD, but it's only thanks to the layoffs of 2016 that he decided to learn how to write his own code rather than to rely on others. He stepped into oil and gas in the North Sea with ExxonMobil; became a geomodeller and operations geologist in the Niger Delta with Addax Petroleum; and worked West Africa and the fractured carbonates of the Middle East, doing extensive field work in Iraqi Kurdistan, with Oryx Petroleum. He read Geological Sciences at the University of Leeds and the ETH in ZÃ¼rich, and has a PhD from Imperial College, London. He now codes for Agile Geoscience and the community using mostly Python and Javascript, is online at agilescientific.com and obsidiancode.io, and is @obsidiancode on twitter and medium.
