Drew Steen doesn't put much value on consistency. He's got an Sc.B. in Chemistry (Brown University), a Ph.D. in Marine Sciences (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), and spent 5 years getting paid to do science in Microbiology departments (Aarhus University, Denmark, and the University of Tennessee - Knoxville). Now he's an Assistant Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville. His [academic work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JKSGdVIAAAAJ&hl=en) is about the processes by which complex organic matter get oxidized in aquatic environments. He likes hoppy IPAs, harassing graduate students about the value of reproducible research, and saying "y'all", smug in the knowledge that it is less ambiguous than any other second-person plural prounoun in English.
