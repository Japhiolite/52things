# Computer vision for fault interpretation
     
Matteo Niccoli

Chapter in progress.

It will be a combination of these two notebooks:

- [fun with faults](https://github.com/mycarta/faults/blob/master/fun_with_faults.ipynb)
- [segyio basic tutorial](https://github.com/mycarta/segyio-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/basic/01_basic_tutorial.ipynb)

Goal is to show how to pick faults semi-automatically on a 3D seismic discontinuity volume, and from those derive fault proximity and fault density attributes, using 3D image morphology techniques.
