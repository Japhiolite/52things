Designing a geophysical filter
     
Chapter in progress (90% done) in a private doc.

It documents the progress in making of a [tutorial](https://github.com/mycarta/2D_FFT_filter_tutorial/blob/master/52-things_tutorial.ipynb) on the frequency filtering of acquisition footprint (modeled and real) in seismic data.


Example in [Figure 1](https://github.com/softwareunderground/52things/blob/master/figures/Niccoli_2_Figure1_placeholder.png)
Discusses theory and practice of 2D Fourier transform and image processing used.
