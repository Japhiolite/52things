X Numpy lessons from making a perceptual colormaps

Chapter in progress (80% done) in a private repo.

The gist of it:
What I learned while in reproducing [Figure 1](https://images.app.goo.gl/aGeNcomJVExzwYJs8) from the paper "Perception of visual information: The role of colour in seismic interpretation", by Froner et alii,First Break, March 2013.

And giving some general advice for how to go about it:
1) Get permissions if data is not open, or if uncertain
2) Define, study and test the equations / functions necessary to replicate the figure
3) Figure out the specific plotting stuff to replicate the figure, and even improve it
4) Extra: go further, add interactivity for others to experiment with it
5) Test on the data that come with the paper, if possible, or other data (model and real)
6) Share it with a permissive license, ideally CC-BY
