## Some advice on reproducing figures

Chapter in progress (90% done) in a private repo.

The gist of it: What I learned in the process of reproducing Figure 1 from the paper "Perception of visual information: The role of colour in seismic interpretation", by Froner et alii, First Break, March 2013.

And giving some general advice for how to go about it:

Get permission. Ask for permission to use the data, if the data is not open, or if uncertain; if it's only a figure, ask for permission to show the original with the reproduced one.
Do the math. Define, study and test the equations / functions and other computations necessary to replicate the figure
Get the plots right. Figure out the specific plotting stuff to replicate the figure (and improve it if necessary)
Extra work. Go further, add interactivity for others to experiment with it
Test the results. Test on the data that come with the paper, if possible, or other data (model and real)
Pay back. Share your results. It with a permissive license, ideally CC-BY
